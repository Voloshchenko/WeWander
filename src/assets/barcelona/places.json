    "desc":"The Sagrada Família, or its full name Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família in Catalan, 'Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family' in English, is a basilica that is now a major symbol of the city of Barcelona throughout the world at the same time as the most famous monument by ’Antoni Gaudí. The architect consecrated sixteen years of his life to his construction, living as a recluse in the building before having an accident and dying in 1926 without his project being completed. Since then he rests in the crypt of the basilica that one can and must visit.",

It's about what is more interesting in this museum. MACBA (Barcelona Contemporary Art Museum) is dedicated to works from the second half of the 20th century. There are few works in the permanent collection and once in a while interesting temporary exhibitions. In1959 the art critic Alexandre Cirici Pellicer believed in the need to create a Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona. Between 1960 and 1963, Cirici and Cesáreo Rodríguez Aguilera headed a group of individuals who began to put together a collection with the objective of constituting the basis for the future museum. In February 1963, the opening of the exhibition El arte y la paz, with a clear political commitment, exposed the narrow limits of what was then permissible. In 1986 Barcelona City Council, invited the North American architect Richard Meier to take charge of the project for the new museum. The City Council's Department of Culture commissioned the art critics Francesc Miralles and Rosa Queralt to draw up a report which would serve to define the philosophy of the future museum. In 1987 the MACBA Foundation brought private enterprise into the project. The MACBA was officially inaugurated on the 28th of November of 1995.",
